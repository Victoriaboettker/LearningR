I am a 25-year-old **medical** student doing a research year at the department of Gynecology and obstetrics. The research is about threatened *preterm birth*.

## Simple code

```{r}
3*3
```

## Testing for Git 

The weather is medium. Not sunny, not rainy - but cloudy.

##  Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
2 + 2

```

```{r}
weight_kilos<-100
weight_kilos
```

```{r}
# Character vector
c("a", "b", "c")
# Logic vector
c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
# Numeric vector
c(1, 5, 6)
# Factor vector (special types of character vectors)
factor(c("low", "high", "medium", "high"))
```

```{r}
head(airquality)
```
